# Destiny 2 Ability Cooldowns
This repository contains a (hopefully) up-to-date collection of ability cooldowns that can be easily parsed by 3rd party applications.

## Disclaimer
- This collection accounts for aspects overriding ability cooldown times but not for exotic armor pieces as they are a lot more volatile comparatively speaking.
- Cooldown times might be 1-2 seconds off in some instances due to how these numbers are calculated. There's really nothing to be done about it.
