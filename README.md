# Destiny 2 Character Stats

This repository contains a (hopefully) up-to-date collection of ability cooldowns as well as other benefits that character stats provide which can be easily parsed by 3rd party applications.

## Disclaimer

- This collection accounts for aspects overriding ability cooldown times but not for exotic armor pieces as they are a lot more volatile comparatively speaking. This repository was created to help alleviate the issues caused by Bungie's API not providing ability cooldown details despite them being in the in-game UI (for the most part).
- Cooldown times might be 1-2 seconds off in some instances due to how these numbers are calculated. There's really nothing to be done about it due to the ungodly workload that would be required to maintain this database by manually checking cooldown times.
